# Contributing

## Workflow

1. Open an issue before major changes.
2. Keep PRs small and focused.
3. Include tests or explain why tests are not applicable.
4. Document API/schema changes in `docs/` and `sql/`.

## Standards

- Write docs in English.
- Use explicit migration files in `sql/`.
- Preserve backward compatibility unless marked breaking.

## Pull Requests

Include:

- Problem statement
- Behavior change
- Schema/API impact
- Test evidence
- Rollback considerations
